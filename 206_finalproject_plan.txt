Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
Option 1

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
class NationalPark 


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
It will accept HTML formatted string as input. 


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
One instance of this class will represent the text information about each national park within each state. 

I will have to create my class before loading all the html data in from the website into each instance of the class (each park).  


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
park_state will contain the state locations for each park (will list city/state or multiple states and if none listed, will find the state at the page where currently being searched through)
park_info will be the text information about each national park (a small paragraph of text about each park)
map_link will get the link to the map location for the park 


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
visitor_score

- What will the method do?
The method will find and return the annual number of visitors to the national parks within the given state. 

- Will it take any additional input? 
Yes, it will take a state input

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a number, but will not affect anything in the input 

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
This allows users of the program to be able to see how much activity the state parks get in total, per state. 


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
highest_attendence

- What will the method do?
The method will take in a list of states and compute the attendence to the parks using the other method, visitor_score. Then will find the highest visitor_score and return that.

- Will it take any additional input? 
Yes, will take a list of states (or links to each state page)

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
Yes, will return the name of the state with the highest number of national parks visitors and the number of visitors as well. 

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
I think users of this program would be interested to see which states recieve the most traffic for their national parks. 

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]

The third method will go through all the states' revenue from national parks and return the state that recieves the highest revenue for it. It will be called highest_revenue. 


* What will the tables in your database be?
A parks table, a states table and an articles table

* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)

For the parks table:
	-park_name: text primary key
	-location: text 
	-Type: (type of park) text
For the states table:
	-state_name: text primary key (2 letter abbreviation)
	-num_parks: integer 
	-revenue: integer (or long?)
For the articles table: 
	-headline: text primary key (from the "News Releases" website)
	-date_released: date type or var char (numbers and dashes)
	-related_park: text (park associated with article)
	

* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")
One of the join querys I will make will involve joining the articles about certain parks on the parks table - It will be the type of park on the park table and the article headline written about the park. Another query I'm going to make involves getting the states with the most parks in them. 


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
I will use a filter function or a lambda and a filter combined to return the top 5 states with more than 10 national parks. I will obtain this number for each state using a query from my database as well (will save into a variable called most_parks). I also plan to use the zip function to make tuples of the top 5 states that gain the highest revenue from their state parks. I may add another method to my class that returns a list of the top 5 revenue numbers gained from the top 5 states. I will then use the zip function to make tuples of the top 5 states and their respective revenue gained. 


* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
I think it's important to see the relationship between how much revenue is generated from national parks and how many national parks are in each state. So I'm hoping that both of my data processing methods will reveal an interesting connection between these two things. 



* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
I will definitely have a .json file output as well as a .txt file for my data processing options and also .db files that contain my databases.
